## Machine Learning Landscape

### 机器学习是什么？

**Machine learning** is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

- **General Definition:**

  > [Machine learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
  > — **Arthur Samuel, 1959**

- **Engineering-Oriented Definition:**

  > A computer program is said to learn from experience \(E\) with respect to some task \(T\) and some performance measure \(P\), if its performance on \(T\), as measured by \(P\), improves with experience \(E\).  
  > — **Tom Mitchell, 1997**
